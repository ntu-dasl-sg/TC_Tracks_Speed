# Tropical Cyclone Tracks (with translational speed)

## Overview:

I calculated the translational speed for synthetic tropical cyclone (TC) tracks for the Philippines for both historical and future-climate conditions.

As input, I used the tracks generated using the Synthetic Tropical cyclOne geneRation Model (STORM) algorithm (see Bloemendaal et al, Generation of a Global Synthetic Tropical cyclone Hazard Dataset using STORM, in review). In the STORM database, Philippines is in the WP basin. Each track data from STORM has information on the time step and location coordinates.

## Data source:

--- Future TC tracks
https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/STORM_Climate_Change_synthetic_tropical_cyclone_tracks/14237678

10,000 years of synthetic tropical cyclone tracks, generated using the Synthetic Tropical cyclOne geneRation Model (STORM) algorithm (see Bloemendaal et al (2020)). The dataset is generated by extracting the climate change signal from each of the four general circulation models listed below, and adding this signal to the historical data from IBTrACS. This new dataset is then used as input for STORM, and resembles future-climate (2015-2050; RCP8.5/SSP5) conditions. The data can be used to calculate tropical cyclone risk in all (coastal) regions prone to tropical cyclones.

--- Historical TC tracks:

Datasets consisting of 10,000 years of synthetic tropical cyclone tracks, generated using the Synthetic Tropical cyclOne geneRation Model (STORM) algorithm (see Bloemendaal et al, Generation of a Global Synthetic Tropical cyclone Hazard Dataset using STORM, in review). The dataset is generated using historical data from IBTrACS and resembles present-climate conditions. The data can be used to calculate tropical cyclone risk in all (coastal) regions prone to tropical cyclones.


## Methodology
The translational speed is calculated as the distance divided by the time interval between consecutive time steps. Calculating the translational speed needs to consider the curvature of the Earth. Hence, I use the haversine formula in computing the great-circle distance between consecutive latitude-longitdue pairs. 

For each TC track from STORM, I added a column that corresponds to the translational speed of the TC's centroid in meters per second.
